#Predictive Maintenance Using AI
This repository presents an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict failure events in milling machines using synthetic sensor and operational data. The goal is to leverage AI techniques to improve predictive maintenance strategies and minimize unexpected equipment downtimes.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview
The dataset used is a synthetic simulation of milling machine operations and includes 10,000 rows with 14 features:


Feature	Description
UDI	Unique Identifier (1â€“10,000)
Product ID	Encodes product type (L, M, H) and serial number
Type	Product quality category: L (low), M (medium), H (high)
Air temperature [K]	Generated using a normalized random walk around 300K
Process temperature [K]	Air temp + 10K + noise
Rotational speed [rpm]	Based on 2860W power with noise
Torque [Nm]	Normally distributed around 40Nm
Tool wear [min]	Wear increases by product type (L/M/H: 2/3/5)
Machine failure	Binary indicator of any failure
TWF, HDF, PWF, OSF, RNF	Specific failure modes
